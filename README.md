# Enchant Anything

## Overview
Enchant Anything is a Minecraft mod that allows you to apply enchantments to any item. You can freely enchant items that normally cannot receive enchantments, creating unique gameplay experiences.

## ⚠️ Warning
**This mod is completely insane and may completely break game balance. Use at your own risk!**

## ✨ Features
* Apply enchantments to any item
* Duplicate enchantments are allowed
* Enchantment costs increase as more enchantments are added
* Functional enchantments work as expected: If an item has an enchantment like Efficiency, it will behave similarly to a tool (e.g., faster mining), but the dropped items remain unchanged
